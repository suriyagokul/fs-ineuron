index.htm or index.html

by default server looks for index.html or default.html file.

Server is a software which serves.

web servers: 

	Apache

	nginx

In hosting services like hostinger, godaddy they uses these apache servers in backend which gives path as /var/html/www and domain name like hc.com/

whenever user hits this hc.com/ we have to show something default right so they by default looks for index.html or default.html.

double click index.html whenever changes occurs it not change automatically we have to reload it.

so there is a software or piece of code which checks for any update in the code then it will automatically reloads the page which is done by a "Live Server".
