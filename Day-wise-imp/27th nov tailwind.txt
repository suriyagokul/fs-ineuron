we have different frameworks like ---> 

	Bootstrap

	Material CSS

	Tailwind

Tailwind is utility first css that means u do one task at a time. 

	Timestamp 27:00

In Tailwind ur classes always acts for mobile devices first incase u want for bigger screens u have to add for it.. 

	Timestamp: 47:00

	EX- class="text-center md:text-left"

		on smaller devices text is center for medium and above devices text is on left.


DIFFERENCE BOOTSTRAP VS TAILWIND  Timestamp: 01:00:00

	In the bootstrap we always go and link the file no matter what the css we are using, what the css we are not using all the css will load up.

	But for tailwind only the classes we have written the equivalent css will generate that only.not loads entire css loads for what we have used.

	So, Tailwind which is less weight when we used with npm


"tailwind mobile first."
