BEM: BLOCK ELEMENT MODIFIER is a methodology/ a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS. 

A block is the element in your React component that wraps all other elements. There is only one block per component.
An Element is within the Block.
A Modifier represents behavior on an Element or Block.

Ex: 

            
            <div className="Counter">
              <button className="Counter__inc">Click me!</button>
              <button className="Counter__inc Counter__inc--disabled" disabled>up</button>
            </div>    

Counter ---> Block
inc     ---> Element
disabled -> action/modifier
