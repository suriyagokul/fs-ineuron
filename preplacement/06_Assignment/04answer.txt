Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.
OOP emphasizes the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Encapsulation allows data and methods to be bundled together within an object, hiding the internal implementation details and providing a public 
interface to interact with the object.
Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from a parent class, promoting code reuse and creating hierarchical relationships.
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexibility and dynamic behavior.
