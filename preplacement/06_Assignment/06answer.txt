Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method or message.
Its purpose is to provide a way to perform a single action in different ways based on the type of the object.
Polymorphism allows code to be written in a generic way, independent of specific object types, promoting flexibility, code reusability, and modularity.
