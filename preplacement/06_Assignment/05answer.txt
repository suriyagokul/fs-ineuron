Abstraction is a fundamental principle of OOP that focuses on exposing essential information while hiding unnecessary details.
Its purpose is to simplify complex systems by breaking them down into manageable and modular units, allowing users to interact with the system using a
simplified and consistent interface.
Abstraction helps in reducing complexity, improving code maintainability, and providing a level of abstraction that hides implementation details.
