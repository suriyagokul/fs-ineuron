Encapsulation is the bundling of data and related methods within a class, hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.
Its purpose is to ensure data integrity, provide access control, and enforce modularity by exposing a public interface for interacting with the
object while hiding the internal state.
Encapsulation helps in organizing code, reducing dependencies, and maintaining the integrity and consistency of data.
