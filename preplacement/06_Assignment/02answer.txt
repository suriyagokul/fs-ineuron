In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the current object or context in which the code is being executed.
Its purpose is to provide a reference to the object that owns the currently executing code.
The value of this depends on how a function is called or the context in which it is used.
Inside a constructor, this refers to the newly created object instance.
