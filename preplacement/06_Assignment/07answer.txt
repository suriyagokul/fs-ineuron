Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, known as the parent or base class.
Its purpose is to promote code reuse, reduce duplication, and establish hierarchical relationships between classes.
Inheritance allows child classes to inherit and extend the functionality of the parent class, enabling the creation of specialized classes while maintaining
a common structure and behavior.
