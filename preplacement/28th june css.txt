Pseudo Selector = Pseudo Class, Psuedo Element

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

Positions in CSS

      By default position is static

      We have different other positions like fixed,sticky,absolute,relative 

Relative: From its current position it will move 

Absolute: From its parent position default it will move according to <body> 

    	  If we give parent container “relative” and child container ”absolute” child will move based on this parent.

Fixed: It will fix at a particular position like navbars 

	If we give position:fixed; top:10px;
	It will fix at 10px from top


Sticky: It will be in particular place when don't scroll. As soon as we scroll the page it will goes to top and stck at that position.
