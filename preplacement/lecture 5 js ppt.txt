Js is a single threaded asynchronous programming language..

In JavaScript, a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations. It is used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not.

A promise may have one of three states.

Temporal Dead Zone

	A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer initializes it with a value
	

	Ex:  Below is called Hoisting
	
	   console.log(a); // undefined

	   var a=2;

	   console.log(a); // reference error. variable a is in temporal dead zone. It's there in script as a:undefined but We can't access it. 

	   let a=2 or const a=2;



undefined vs null

	
	If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined.

	In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value


		function test(x = 1) {
  			console.log(x);
		}

		// passing undefined
		// takes default value 1
		test(undefined); // 1  or test(null) // o/p: null
