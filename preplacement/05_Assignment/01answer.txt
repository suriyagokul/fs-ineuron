Synchronous operations execute one after the other in a sequential manner. Each operation waits for the previous one to complete before moving to the next operation.
Asynchronous operations, on the other hand, do not wait for the previous operation to complete. 
They are non-blocking and allow multiple operations to run concurrently. Asynchronous operations typically involve callbacks, 
Promises, or async/await syntax to handle the results.
