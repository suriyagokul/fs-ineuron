The try and catch blocks are used for error handling in JavaScript.
Code within the try block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it is caught by the catch block. This prevents the program from crashing and allows 
you to handle the error gracefully.
It is important to use error handling to ensure that unexpected exceptions or errors do not cause the entire program to halt.
