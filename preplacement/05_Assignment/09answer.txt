fetch is a modern JavaScript API used to make network requests (HTTP requests) to a server and handle the response asynchronously.
It provides a more flexible and powerful alternative to the older XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object.
fetch returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response from the server.
It allows you to make various types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and provides methods to handle the response data.
