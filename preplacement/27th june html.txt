Semantic tags

	Has some predefined meaning

	Previously in html1,2,34 what happened is we write whole html in multiple nested divs its so irritating. So in html5 they come up with these tags

		Ex: main,header,footer,nav,section,aside,article

Accessibility 

	This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible. 

	semantic HTML is the key starting point toward good accessibility practices.

	for button we use button tag, dont write it in div like 

		<div class=“button”></div>

	We use semantics tag for accessibility
