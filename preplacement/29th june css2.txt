        			--primary: purple  // --primary is variable name
				--color2: red
      			}
      			
			h1 {
        			color: var(--primary);  // we can access variable using var(var_name)
      			}
    		</style>
  
		<body>
      			<h1>Hello World! </h1>

Flex and Grid:

	Flex is one Dimensional  (either row or column)

	Grid is two dimensional (row,column)

	gap is used to give space on both row wise and column wise

	flex space around vs space evenly
	
		space evenly distributes complete space into equal parts

		whereas In space-around: space between the columns are in same size. space before first column and space after last column is same size  

	Flex Wrap: 

		If a container of 10 items has fixed width and height has given flex.. Then all the items are fit into one row without applying our width 		and height. So when we use flex wrap it will show the no of boxes which are only fit in a row nd remaining comes in next row.

			flex-wrap: wrap 

	1fr means "take 1 fraction of the available space", and since there are no other element defined as fr, it also means "take all available space".

	auto means take space based on its content

	grid-template-columns: how many no of columns u need in a single row

		Ex: grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;  // 2 columns with same width
			
		    grid-template-columns: 50px 300px; // 2 columns where first column width is 50px and second column width is 300px
 	
	gird-template-rows: It is like height of the row

		Ex: grid-template-rows: 200px; The first row in this grid is 200px high

		    grid-template-rows: 200px 100px; The first row in this grid is 200px high, and the second row is 100px high:
