Both map and forEach are array methods in JavaScript.
The main difference is that map creates a new array by applying a provided function to each element of the original array, whereas forEach executes a provided function for each element of the array without creating a new array.
map returns a new array with the results of the provided function applied to each element, while forEach does not return anything.
If you need to modify or transform an array, you generally use map. If you simply want to iterate over the elements of an array, you can use forEach.
