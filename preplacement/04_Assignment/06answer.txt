ðŸ’¡ Q.6 What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?

Template literals, also known as template strings, are a feature in ES6 that allow for easier string interpolation and multiline strings.
They are denoted by backticks ( ) instead of single or double quotes.
Template literals support embedded expressions using ${expression} syntax, allowing variables or expressions to be directly interpolated within the string.
Example usage:
javascript
Copy code
const name = 'John';
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, John!
