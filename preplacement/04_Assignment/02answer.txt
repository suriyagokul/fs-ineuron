Temporal Dead Zone: It is a state where variable is there but we can't accessible.And during this zone javascript will always through
a reference error if anyone tries to access those variables. 

  For Example: console.log(a) // here variable a is in temporal Dead Zone
               let a=20;
               console.log(a) // here a is out of temporal dead zone
