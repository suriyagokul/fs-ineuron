ðŸ’¡ Q.5 What is the difference between let and const?

let and const are both block-scoped variables introduced in ES6.
The main difference is that let allows reassignment of its value, while const variables are read-only and cannot be reassigned once they are defined.
However, it's important to note that const does not make objects or arrays immutable. It only ensures that the binding to the variable itself cannot be 
changed. The properties of a const object or array can still be modified.
