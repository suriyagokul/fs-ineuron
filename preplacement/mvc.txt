MVC	Model View Controller

MVC - Architectural pattern that separates applications into three main categories; the model, the view, and the controller.

It helps you breakup the frontend and backend code into separate components

Frontend (View) will send request to controller

Controller talks with Model(Database)

Model Send response to Controller and Again   controller send response to view.

Monolithic vs MicroServices Architecture

Monolithic consists of single central database which is a problem

	Because for example - If Family in one house if any leakage occurs it will problem to entire family

	Ex: pwskills

Web Applications usually consists of three parts

	Front End client-side application is written in JavaScript and other languages.

	Back End Server-side application which contains business logic written in java, PHP, Python or some other language.

	Database of whole web application

	Hence the whole web application works as a monolith where every part is dependent on others.

But in MicroServices Architecture big web applications are divided into smaller services, where each web service is responsible for executing a particular set of functionalities

	Ex: Netflix

Small Projects - Monolithic is good/enough

Database

Schema: Simply means Database Design

Sql vs NoSql

	Sql - Relational
	
	NoSql - Non Relational 	

Project Needs to be - 

CRUD

Authentication
