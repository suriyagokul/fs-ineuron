apt-get update vs apt-get upgrade

	The update command only updates the package list with the latest available versions, however, it does not install or upgrade the package. The upgrade     
      command actually upgrades and installs the latest versions of packages that are already installed.

uname

uname -r gives agent version

unamr -a

cd foldername

mkdir dirname

touch filename.txt  creates file

rm filename.txt     delete file

when we write ls -l it will show all the permissions for file

	like drwxr-xr..

	Each permission divided into 3 parts


		1) admin

		2) group

		3) public

	1-->  Execute

	2-->  Write

	4-->  Read

	For ex if we want to give read, write execute permissions then 1+2+4 = 7
	To give only write permission = 2
	Read permission = 4
	R+X --> 4+1 = 5

	Ex: chmod 721

		It means for admin we are giving r,w,execute permissions because 1+2+4=7 
			   for group we are giving write perm only i.e 2
			   for public we are giving exec perm only i.e 1

chmod 777 filename.txt
