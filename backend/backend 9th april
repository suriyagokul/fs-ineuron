mongoose create vs save
  
    save() can only be used on a new document of the model
    create() can be used on the model. 
    
    Ex: we can use any one of two methods 
    
      exports.createTour = async (req, res) => {
        // method 1
        const newTour = await Tour.create(req.body);

        // method 2
        const newTour = new Tour(req.body);
        await newTour.save();
      }
     
Use Error class object to throw server errors

  throw new Error("please provide details")
  
  
Ref collections
  
    category: {}  (category collection)
    
    In Product Collection 
    
        categoryId {
          type:monogoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
          ref:Category
        }
  
  
localStorage vs Cookies

     Cookies are primarily for reading server-side.
     Local storage can only be read by the client-side. So the question is, in your app, who needs this data â€” the client or the server?

    localstorage stores in browser side
    cookies stored in browser and server side
    
    localstorage has no expiration until browser memory is purged
    cookies has expiration which we can set manually
