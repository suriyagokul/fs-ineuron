Vite

	Like CRA (create-react-app) we have vite to create a template..

	CRA uses webpack to bundle and takes time but vite uses esbuild.

	It's very faster than cra

Steps: 

	1) npm create vite@latest

	2) Give project name, framework and variant typescript or js
	
	   √ Project name: ... redux-todo
	   √ Select a framework: » React
         √ Select a variant: » JavaScript

	3) enter into that project

	4) npm install // which installs all the dependencies which are there on package.json

	5) npm run dev  // to start the project
